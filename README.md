# HardcorePlus+ 

HardcorePlus+ is a **server-side only** mod for Minecraft that raises the stakes of multiplayer hardcore worlds. When any player dies, the **entire world is deleted and a new one is automatically generated**. The goal is for players to really think about their actions. 

## Features

- **Server-Side Only:** No client installation needed; simply add to your server mods folder.
- **Automatic World Reset:** When a player dies, the server wipes the world and generates a fresh one.
- **Multiplayer Focus:** Designed for groups seeking a truly hardcore experience with no second chances.

## Getting Started

### How to Create a Wrapper

To ensure smooth server restarts after a world reset, itâ€™s recommended to use a wrapper script. Below is a simple example in Bash (Linux/macOS):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
while true; do
  java -Xmx4G -jar server.jar nogui
  echo "Server crashed or stopped. Restarting in 5 seconds..."
  sleep 5
done
```

- Place this script in your server directory.
- Update `server.jar` with your actual Minecraft server JAR name.
- Run the script instead of launching the server directly.

For Windows, a batch file example:

```batch
@echo off
:loop
java -Xmx4G -jar server.jar nogui
echo Server crashed or stopped. Restarting in 5 seconds...
timeout /t 5
goto loop
```
